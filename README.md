# personal-models
many models machine learning function to determine best model to start using, and building encoding functions eventually to determine which encoding is best per data type/usage
# Requirements
pandas  
numpy

# instructions
    1. install dependencies  
    2. run .ipynb file  
    3. determine which model is best to continue processing
